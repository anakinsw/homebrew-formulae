Formulae available
==================

avi-metaedit
------------

AVI metadata tool made available from the US National Archives.

lensfun
-------

A library for correcting lens abberations in photos. Added as a
dependency for Darktable.

darktable
---------

Raw photo processing software using GTK+. I haven't had much chance to
try this yet, but was inspired to give it a go based on
[Lewis Collard's review](http://lewiscollard.com/tmp/darktable-linux-review/).
Seems to work okay but haven't tested everything yet.
