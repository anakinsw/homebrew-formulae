Formulae available
==================

twee
----

A commandline compiler for [Twine](http://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/).

org2xm
------

A utility to convert the soundtrack to Cave Story into FastTracker 2 .xm modules.

darktable
---------

Raw photo processing software using GTK+. I haven't had much chance to
try this yet, but was inspired to give it a go based on
[Lewis Collard's review](http://lewiscollard.com/tmp/darktable-linux-review/).
Seems to work okay but haven't tested everything yet.

Argyll CMS
----------

[Argyll](http://www.argyllcms.com/) is a colour calibration system which
allows calibration of monitors, capture equipment (such as scanners,
cameras, etc.) and printers. It can create ICC profiles for calibrated
devices.

This formula is just an installer for the binaries from the Argyll site
as a convenience, and has been minimally tested so far.

[compleat](http://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2009/10/30/compleat.html)
--------

Completion-writing tool for bash and zsh.

aview
-----

Hackily customized noninteractive version of aview, the image-to-ASCII converter. This is needed to convert videos for [hotline](https://github.com/mistydemeo/hotline).

xmdp
----

Port of Future Crew's [MusicDiskPlayer](http://www.textfiles.com/computers/DOCUMENTATION/fcinfo17.txt) to the [libxmp](http://xmp.sourceforge.net/) playback library.
